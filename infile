The program has to open the "infile" and the "outfile".
It has to make a pipe. It can do it with only one pipe.
It needs to fork into 2 commands.
Redirect the pipe from the output of one command to the input of the other.
Redirect the standard input of the first command to the infile.
Redirect the output of the second command to outfile.
It has to close the pipes.
Hello
The input needs to be parsed.

./pipex infile "ls -la" "wc -l" outfile

The input would be:
argv[0] = "./pipex"
argv[1] = "infile"
argv[2] = "ls -la"
argv[3] = "wc -l"
argv[4] = "outfile"

What does execve need?
Execve needs the path to the executable, it needs the arguments for the executable, and it needs a pointer to the environments variables.

so for ls:
execve("bin/ls", {"ls" "-la", NULL}, envp);

for wc:
execve("bin/wc", {"wc" "-l", NULL}, envp);

envp would look something like this:

SHELL=/bin/zsh
TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION=3.4.16
TERM_PROGRAM=iTerm.app
PATH=/Users/dritsema/.brew/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/munki:/opt/X11/bin:/Users/dritsema/.brew/opt/fzf/bin
HOME=/Users/dritsema
USER=dritsema
LOGNAME=dritsema

Thats it for now...
